        What is Ptalk?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Ptalk is a simple private chat program made with html.
        The point of Ptalk is to keep YOUR conversations private and stop people from
        saving YOUR data. Ptalk has nothing to do with any current "Private" chat program out there
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">
    `Why choose Ptalk?
    </h2>

    <p style="text-align:center">
        Ptalk offers security and no chat saving. Your messages do go through our server, but we do not save chats or look at them, your chats go straight to who your talking to and no one else. We here at Ptalk do not and hopefully will never sell your data to vendors or anyone else.
    </p>

        Why not use Ptalk?
    </h2>

    <p style="text-align:center">
        Although i have talked about the pros of Ptalk, we do (Sadly) have cons to our program, such as: This was made by a single 14 year old boy so its code is quite messy and weak, meaning it is very possible if we got hacked that you could have your account taken, although because as stated we do not save chats, no one will see your chats, but they may send a message to someone without you knowing or something along that line. At this time the app is stuck in dark mode and does not have a light mode(Light mode is in the works)
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">
        What are the plans for Ptalks future?
    </h2>

    <p style="text-align:center">
        We plan on adding a server(ELEGOO UNO R3 with ethernet shield) We also plan on adding light and dark mode(Not just dark) We will make it so you can use an account.
